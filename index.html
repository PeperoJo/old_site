              In my spring 2019 Human Computer Interaction class, my team prototyped an iOS application that would help students, staff, and guest find seats throughout the Hesburgh Library. This was a project that emphasized more on UI/UX study than design. We initially noticed a widespread issue of students struggling to find seats that suit their study needs, especially during finals week. We incorporated features that would fix this by allowing seat searches with different properties. We followed the steps of prototyping and applied the knowledge of HCI that we learned in class. Check out our cases study and design report that includes our development and feedback studies.

My team and I decided to build a tool that acts as a social ground for people to discover each other for activities. As we get comfortable with our friend groups, it is hard to get out and meet new people. We also come across situations when we need one or two more people for certain activities. That's when necto. comes into play. Users can post various activities with or without set limit on the number of participants. Other users can then join in and View more information of the event. As the lead designer for this project, I made sure to make an easy, straightforward user experience. The front end was created with React and Bootstrap.

              For the 2017 AT&T Hackathon held at South bend, my team and I decided to build an Android app that helps people pick outfits. It allows people to build their own custom wardrobe by simply taking pictures of their apparels. Implementing IBM Watson API allowed us to easily identify what types of clothes the user had as well as the colors and styles. This tool was specifically designed to generate outfits depending on the weather of the location that the user was in. As it is used more often, the app gradually better understands the style of the users and also creates a recommendation feed of the latest fashion trends. The app was built using Android Studio.

              As part of the GE Align Lighting Technology project, I collaborated with team members to develop an LED light bulb that could change its color based on the time of day or the color preference of the user. The tunable bulb was to produce both the energizing effect of the GE Align AM bulb  and the soothing effect of the GE Align PM bulb. I helped develop the backend code in MATLAB that calculates different color tones as well as created the GUI that allows users to pick their color choice from CIE color space. I also assisted in designing the circuit using an Arduino breadboard.
